Our project is called `Defi Balancer Booster`.
The project is a mashup between Gnosis Pay, yearn and Ajna.

For people who have never used Gnosis Pay, it works as a checking account with a debit card.
The big difference is that Gnosis Pay allows self-custody of your assets through a SAFE.
Every time the card is used, Gnosis Pay pulls funds from the safe and pays for the transaction in the real world.


Our project pushes the system's boundaries by making a deeper connection to DeFi.
We are going to focus on two different use cases, a saving account, and what we call a debt account. 
For the Saving account, the user has a separate contract holding most of the assets and it's earning yield through a yearn vault.

The debt account mimics a credit card.
It uses the deposited capital in the yearn vault as collateral in a money market.
